# vimrc

Due to my recent adventures with vim, I decided to have a similar environment on a dozen or so different machines and the easies way todo so is to have a repo with all my config and bundles.

## Setup

1.

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

2.

ln vimrc file from repo to ~/.vimrc

3.

vim +PluginInstall +qall

you should now be all set.

## Focus

this config is mostly based on the idea of having vim as efficient python ide

### Requirements

This installation requires a lot of vim specific features, so it's best you compile vim from scratch
